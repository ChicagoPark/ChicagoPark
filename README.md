I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Generative AI at [WashU](https://cigroup.wustl.edu/), fortunately working with [Prof. Ulugbek S. Kamilov](https://ukmlv.github.io/). I was a prior research intern at [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov/) in 2024 summer. I graduated summa cum laude with a B.S. in Computer Science at [WashU](https://cigroup.wustl.edu/) in 2024. My research interests lie at the intersection of generative models and their applications to medical and real-world problems.
